Data-Camp-Project-1
Hello everyone. Hope you all are doing well. 
So recently I came across the Data-Camp projects. It has some amazing projects so, I tried one and my experince was good. 
The project was guided one. It was based on the "Dr.Semmelweis and the discovery of Handwashing".
In my experience it is an amazing start. You will enjoy it.

The aim of the project was to Reanalyse the data behind one of the most important discoveries of the medicine: Handwashing.

Actually the project is divided into 9 Tasks.

1] Meet Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis

2] The alarming number of deaths

3] Death at the clinics

4] The handwashing begins

5] The effect of handwashing

6] The effect of handwashing highlighted

7] More handwashing, fewer deaths?

8] A Bootstrap analysis of Semmelweis handwashing data

9] The fate of Dr. Semmelweis

I hope you all will like this basic project.
